# What is this code?

I got into programming writing MUD code in C way back in the day; back when AOL keywords were a thing. A MUD is essentially a terminal program much like IRC only instead of just chatting you also killed monsters (and other players!) and explored.

Whenever I learn a new language I do it by writing a MUD-like 'game'. I say game lightly because the point is never to have a completed MUD as no-one still is into that sort of thing, but it is a great way to learn a language, especially systems programming.

## This go code contains no warranties whatsoever

I make no claims about the correctness of efficiency of any of the code here. If I can successfully add items and players to a room via pointer I am super happy. I am trying to keep it _idiomatic_ GO because I roll like that, Python, Ruby, Javascript, C, whatever.
